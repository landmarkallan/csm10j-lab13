I'm completely confused/overwhelmed by what exactly I need to use~do for the graphing, as I read the book's material and your examples, I'm getting more confused. I just need to see an example to understand what's needed. As I'm completely new to graphics in programming, and haven't got everything straightened out. Do I create a pane (JPane) or do I use a Component/Container, do I use a graphical Object (Graphics g) and just draw the ovals and/or do I use the Interfaces (MouseListener)?
